          <p class="muted" style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.7;">
            Sankalp Learning Center operates as a program under the Sankalp Inclusive Foundation, a nonprofit organization founded with a heartfelt commitment to serving neurodiverse children and their families.
          </p>
          <p class="muted" style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.7; margin-top: 16px;">
            The Founders of Sankalp Inclusive Foundation, Mr. Hariharan V. Nochur and Mrs. Managalam Hariharan, have long shared a passion for creating inclusive, meaningful opportunities for children with special needs. Their vision emphasizes whole-person development—integrating academics, life skills, and vocational readiness to support long-term independence and dignity.
          </p>
          <p class="muted" style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.7; margin-top: 16px;">
            Inspired by this shared commitment, the Founders were deeply moved by the micropod concept and lived-experience–driven vision developed by Radhika Balasubramanian, and supported the establishment of Sankalp Learning Center as a parent-led educational initiative.

          <h3 style="font-size: 1.3rem; margin-top: 32px; margin-bottom: 16px; color: var(--theme-primary);">🌼 About the School Administrator & Micropod Visionary – Radhika Balasubramanian</h3>
          <p class="muted" style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.7;">
            Radhika Balasubramanian is the School Administrator and Founding Visionary of Sankalp Learning Center. The concept of a parent-led, neurodiverse micropod is rooted entirely in her lived experience, professional background, and years of advocacy.
          </p>
          <p class="muted" style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.7; margin-top: 16px;">
            Radhika holds a Bachelor's degree in Psychology, with specialization in Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA), and is a certified Social and Emotional Learning (SEL) Mentor and Mindfulness Coach.
          </p>
          <p class="muted" style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.7; margin-top: 16px;">
            Most importantly, she is a mother of three children, two of whom are on the autism spectrum—one with high support needs and one with high-functioning autism. Over 15 years of hands-on caregiving, advocacy, learning, and resilience, Radhika experienced firsthand the limitations of traditional systems that often struggle to meet the complex and individualized needs of neurodiverse learners.
          </p>
          <p class="muted" style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.7; margin-top: 16px;">
            Through this journey, she developed a clear and powerful idea:<br>
            <em>children with neurodiverse needs deserve a learning environment intentionally designed around them—not one that asks them to fit into rigid structures.</em>
          </p>
          <p class="muted" style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.7; margin-top: 16px;">
            This idea gave rise to Sankalp Learning Center—a small, parent-led micropod designed to feel like a home away from home, where learning is individualized, progress is celebrated in small steps, and emotional safety is foundational.
          </p>
          <p class="muted" style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.7; margin-top: 16px;">
            As School Administrator, Radhika leads the day-to-day operations, program design, parent collaboration, and educational philosophy of Sankalp. Her approach emphasizes:

            <li style="margin-bottom: 8px;">Individualized learning profiles rooted in each child's strengths</li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 8px;">Parent partnership as a cornerstone of success</li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 8px;">Emotional regulation, dignity, and empathy as prerequisites for learning</li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 8px;">Practical preparation for independence, life skills, and vocational pathways</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 style="font-size: 1.3rem; margin-top: 32px; margin-bottom: 16px; color: var(--theme-primary);">🌟 A Shared Commitment</h3>
          <p class="muted" style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.7;">
            Together, Sankalp Inclusive Foundation, its Founders, and the leadership of Sankalp Learning Center share a unified goal:<br>
            <em>to support and sustain a parent-led, child-centered micropod where neurodiverse learners are empowered to grow academically, emotionally, and functionally—guided by lived experience, compassion, and purpose.</em>
