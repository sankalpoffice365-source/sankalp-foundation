            Sankalp Learning Center is a compassionate, child-centered educational initiative created to serve children with diverse learning needs—especially those with autism, ADHD, learning differences, and developmental challenges. We believe every child deserves a place where they are understood, valued, and given the freedom to learn at their own pace.
          </p>
          <p class="muted" style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.7; margin-top: 16px;">
            The center is fully operated by Sankalp Inclusive Foundation, a nonprofit organization dedicated to building inclusive learning opportunities for the community. At this early stage of our growth, the foundation and the learning center function as one unified mission: to support children and families through meaningful, individualized education.
          </p>
          <p class="muted" style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.7; margin-top: 16px;">
            Our approach blends structured learning, hands-on experiences, movement, creativity, and self-directed exploration. We honor every child's identity, provide emotional safety, and partner closely with families to help each learner grow academically, socially, and independently.
          </p>

            <strong>Our Story</strong><br>
            Sankalp began with one simple realization: families of children with special needs often feel alone, misunderstood, or underserved by traditional systems. Seeing this struggle up close, we wanted to create something different—a place built with compassion, understanding, and flexibility.
          </p>
          <p class="muted" style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.7; margin-top: 16px;">
            What started as a vision to build multiple community programs quickly became clear: everything must begin with a strong learning center. So today, Sankalp Inclusive Foundation and Sankalp Learning Center stand together as one, focused entirely on building a safe, structured, and nurturing space for children.
          </p>
          <p class="muted" style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.7; margin-top: 16px;">
            Our name, Sankalp, means promise or determination—a commitment to every child and family who walks through our doors.
